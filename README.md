# Drowsiness_detection
This repository is for drowsiness detection


Eye Aspect Ratio for :

Active State = greater than 0.25 

Drowsy State = greater than 0.19 and less than equal to 0.25

Sleep State = less than 0.19

In my case value of Eye Aspect ratio depends on video quality (image is clear or not) and position of head.

Most important challenges during completing this project on local system is installing all package like openCV,dlib and imutils.
